## Troubleshooting

### Extension not filling forms

**Check if synced:**
- Click extension icon
- Should show "‚úÖ Synced as [your name]"
- If not, click "Sync Profile from SwipeJob"

**Check if form is supported:**
- Extension looks for common field names (name, email, phone, etc.)
- Some custom forms may not auto-fill
- Use "Fill Forms on This Page" button manually

**Reload the page:**
- Some SPAs (Single Page Apps) need a refresh
- Press F5 or Ctrl+R

### Forms partially filled

**This is normal!**
- Extension fills common fields only
- You'll still need to:
  - Upload resume file (security restriction)
  - Answer custom questions
  - Select dropdowns (location, work type, etc.)

**What to do:**
- Review all fields
- Fill remaining fields manually
- Should still save 70-80% of time

### Extension not syncing

**Make sure you're logged into SwipeJob:**
- Open SwipeJob in another tab
- Log in if needed
- Try syncing again

**Manual sync:**
1. Go to SwipeJob ‚Üí Profile
2. Copy your details
3. Open extension ‚Üí manual entry (future feature)

### Filled data incorrect

**Update your SwipeJob profile:**
- Extension uses data from SwipeJob
- Update your profile there
- Re-sync extension

**Or edit directly in forms:**
- Just type over the auto-filled data
- Next sync will use updated info

    'input[id*="newfield"]',
  ],
};

// Then in autoFillForms():

if (newField && userData.newField) {
  fillField(newField, userData.newField, 'newField');
}
```
