# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Issue
Vercel is showing raw JavaScript code instead of the website.

## Root Cause
Vercel is serving the wrong file - it's serving the server bundle (`dist/index.js`) instead of the client HTML (`dist/public/index.html`).

## Solution Attempts

### Attempt 1: Complex routing ❌
- Used `routes` with filesystem handler
- Didn't work - Vercel still served wrong file

### Attempt 2: Simplified rewrites ❌  
- Simplified to just rewrites
- Set `outputDirectory` to `dist/public`
- Still showing raw JS

### Attempt 3: Check Vercel Build Logs
**YOU NEED TO DO THIS:**

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Click on the latest deployment
4. Click "Building" or "Build Logs"
5. **Look for these issues:**
   - Is the build completing successfully?
   - What files are in the output?
   - Is `dist/public/index.html` being created?
   - Any warnings about missing files?

## Alternative Solution: Manual Vercel Configuration

If auto-deployment isn't working, try **manual configuration in Vercel Dashboard**:

### Step 1: Vercel Project Settings
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings
2. Under "Build & Development Settings":
   - **Framework Preset:** Other
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory:** `dist/public`
   - **Install Command:** `npm install`

### Step 2: Check Root Directory
- **Root Directory:** Leave blank (or `.`)

### Step 3: Function Configuration  
Under "Functions":
- **Node.js Version:** 20.x

### Step 4: Redeploy
Click "Redeploy" after saving settings.

## Quick Test: Deploy Just Static Files

To isolate the issue, let's try deploying JUST the static site (no API):

1. **Temporarily remove API from vercel.json:**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public"
}
```

2. **Redeploy**
3. **Check if site loads**
4. **Then add API back**

## Debugging Steps

### Check Local Build
```bash
npm run build
ls -la dist/public/
cat dist/public/index.html
```

**Should see:**
- ✅ `dist/public/index.html` (HTML file)
- ✅ `dist/public/assets/*.js` (bundled JS)
- ✅ `dist/public/assets/*.css` (bundled CSS)

### Check What Vercel Is Serving
1. Go to your Vercel URL
2. View Page Source (Ctrl+U)
3. **What do you see?**
   - HTML? ✅ Good!
   - JavaScript? ❌ Wrong file being served

## Nuclear Option: Vercel CLI

If dashboard doesn't work, use Vercel CLI:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy from command line
vercel --prod
```

This often works when auto-deploy fails.

## What to Check in Vercel Dashboard RIGHT NOW

1. **Deployments Tab:**
   - Is the latest deployment "Ready"?
   - Any errors shown?

2. **Build Logs:**
   - Did `npm run build` succeed?
   - Were files created in `dist/public/`?

3. **Functions Tab:**
   - Is there an `api/index` function?
   - Is it working?

4. **Domains Tab:**
   - What URL is your site on?
   - Try visiting `https://your-url.vercel.app/index.html` directly

## Expected vs Actual

### Expected:
```
User visits: https://your-site.vercel.app
Vercel serves: dist/public/index.html
Browser loads: React app
```

### Actual (Current):
```
User visits: https://your-site.vercel.app
Vercel serves: dist/index.js (server bundle)
Browser shows: Raw JavaScript code
```

## Next Steps

**RIGHT NOW - Check these in order:**

1. ✅ **Vercel Build Logs** - Did build succeed?
2. ✅ **Vercel Deployment Status** - Is it "Ready"?
3. ✅ **Try direct URL** - Visit `your-url.vercel.app/index.html`
4. ✅ **Check Output Directory** - In Vercel settings
5. ✅ **Try Vercel CLI** - Deploy manually

**Then report back:**
- What do build logs say?
- What happens when you visit `/index.html` directly?
- What's the current "Output Directory" setting in Vercel?
