# Starting App Without Database Migrations

## 📊 **Current Situation:**

Your Supabase dashboard only shows the direct connection (port 5432), which doesn't work in this environment due to IPv6.

**But we can still run the app!**

---

## ✅ **What WILL Work Without Database Migrations:**

### **Frontend Features (Using Supabase Client):**
1. ✅ User signup/login (Supabase Auth)
2. ✅ AI resume parsing (Groq API)
3. ✅ AI cover letter generation (Groq API)
4. ✅ Enhanced UI (all pages render)
5. ✅ Dark mode, responsive design

### **Why These Work:**
- Frontend uses `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` + `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` ✅
- These connect via Supabase client (not direct PostgreSQL)
- AI uses Groq API (no database needed) ✅

---

## ❌ **What WON'T Work (Backend Routes):**

Backend API routes need the database:
- ❌ Job listings
- ❌ Application tracking
- ❌ Swipe limits
- ❌ Badges
- ❌ Referrals
- ❌ Analytics

**Why:** Backend uses Drizzle ORM which needs the direct PostgreSQL connection.

## 🚀 **Let's Start the App Anyway!**

I'll start the dev server and we can:
1. Test authentication
2. Test AI features
3. See the enhanced UI
4. Identify what needs the database

Then we can work around it or manually create tables in Supabase.
