## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Extension not filling forms?

1. **Check sync status:**
   - Click extension icon
   - Should show "✅ Synced"
   - If not, re-sync from `/extension-sync`

2. **Reload page:**
   - Some sites need refresh
   - Press F5 or Ctrl+R

3. **Check console:**
   - F12 → Console → Look for "SwipeJob:" messages
   - Should see "Filled X fields"

### Forms partially filled?

**This is normal!**
- Extension fills common fields only
- Custom questions need manual answers
- Dropdowns need manual selection
- Resume upload is manual (security)

### Sync not working?

1. **Make sure logged into SwipeJob**
2. **Try manual copy:**
   - `/extension-sync` → Copy Data
   - Paste into extension settings (future feature)
3. **Check browser console** for errors
