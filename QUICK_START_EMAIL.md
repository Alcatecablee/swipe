# Email Applications - Quick Start (5 Minutes)

## What This Does

Instead of fake Google search URLs, your app now **sends real email applications** to employers. When users swipe right on jobs with email support, the system:

1. ‚úÖ Generates AI cover letter
2. ‚úÖ Sends professional HTML email
3. ‚úÖ Tracks submission with message ID
4. ‚úÖ Shows "Application Submitted" status

**Coverage: 30-40% of jobs** can be applied via email instantly.

   - Enable 2-Factor Auth if not enabled
   - Generate app password for "Mail"
   - Copy the 16-character password

2. **Add to Replit Secrets** (or create `.env` file):
   ```bash

   EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com

  'Test Company',
  'R20,000',
  'Cape Town',
  'Test job. Apply by emailing your-email@gmail.com',  -- YOUR EMAIL!
  ARRAY['Testing'],
  'your-email@gmail.com',  -- YOUR EMAIL!
  'email'
);

2. Navigate to /app (swipe page)
3. Look for jobs with **green "Instant Apply"** badge
4. Swipe right (or click "Instant Apply" button)

**In server logs:**
```
‚úÖ Email application sent successfully to your-email@gmail.com
   Message ID: <unique-message-id>
```

**In database:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM applications 
WHERE submission_method = 'email' 
ORDER BY applied_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Should show:
-- submission_method: 'email'
-- email_sent_to: 'your-email@gmail.com'
-- status: 'submitted'
```

## Visual Indicators

### Jobs with Email Support Show:
- **Top-right badge:** "Instant Apply" (green, pulsing)

## Troubleshooting

### "Email service not configured"
‚Üí Add EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASSWORD to Replit Secrets
‚Üí Restart server after adding

### "No email address found"
‚Üí Job doesn't have email in description
‚Üí Add `application_email` to job manually

### "Failed to send email"
‚Üí Gmail: Check app-specific password is correct
‚Üí Check credentials are in environment
‚Üí Try sending test email via SMTP tool

### Email in spam folder
‚Üí Normal for first few emails
‚Üí Move to inbox and mark "Not spam"
‚Üí For production: Use Resend/SendGrid + domain verification

### Server not picking up env vars
‚Üí Restart server after adding Replit Secrets
‚Üí Check spelling of variable names
‚Üí Use `console.log(process.env.EMAIL_USER)` to verify

## What's Different

### Before (Fake):
```
User swipes right
  ‚Üì
Generate cover letter
  ‚Üì
Create Google search URL ‚ùå
  ‚Üì
Status: "auto_applied" (misleading!)
```

### After (Real):
```
User swipes right
  ‚Üì
Generate cover letter
  ‚Üì
Send email to employer ‚úÖ
  ‚Üì
Status: "submitted" (honest!)
```

## Production Checklist

Before launching to real users:

- [ ] Set up SPF/DKIM DNS records
- [ ] Test with 20+ applications
- [ ] Monitor spam rates

## Cost Estimate

**Gmail:** Free, but limited and unprofessional
**Resend:** R200/month for 50,000 emails (recommended)
**SendGrid:** R500/month for 40,000 emails

For 1,000 applications/month ‚Üí **R200 with Resend**

---

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Check env vars loaded
node -e "console.log(process.env.EMAIL_USER)"

# Test SMTP connection (create test-smtp.js)
node test-smtp.js

# Check sent emails in DB
psql -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM applications WHERE submission_method='email'"

# View recent email applications
psql -c "SELECT j.title, a.email_sent_to, a.applied_at FROM applications a JOIN jobs j ON j.id = a.job_id WHERE submission_method='email' ORDER BY applied_at DESC LIMIT 5"
```

3. **Build browser extension** (+50% coverage)
4. **API integrations** (Pnet, Indeed)
5. **A/B test email templates**
