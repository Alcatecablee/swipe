## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Email not sending?

```bash
# Check env vars are set
echo $EMAIL_USER
echo $EMAIL_PASSWORD

# Check logs
npm run dev
# Look for: "Email application sent successfully"

# Test SMTP manually
node -e "
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
const transport = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: { user: 'YOUR_EMAIL', pass: 'YOUR_APP_PASSWORD' }
});
transport.sendMail({
  from: 'YOUR_EMAIL',
  to: 'YOUR_EMAIL',
  subject: 'Test',
  text: 'Works!'
}, console.log);
"
```

### Extension not filling forms?

```bash
# 1. Check extension loaded
chrome://extensions/
# Should show SwipeJob Auto-Fill

# 2. Check synced
Click extension icon
# Should show "✅ Synced as [name]"

# 3. Check console
F12 → Console → Filter "SwipeJob"
# Should see: "SwipeJob: Filled X fields"

# 4. Try manual fill
Click extension icon → "Fill Forms on This Page"
```

### Database migration failed?

```sql
-- Check if columns exist
SELECT column_name 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'jobs' 
  AND column_name IN ('application_email', 'application_method');

-- If empty, run migration again
-- Copy paste from supabase-email-migration.sql
```
